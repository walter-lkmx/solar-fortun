          <h3>Winery Visits</h3>
          <p>Are you planning on visiting us and have questions? Here is a quick guide for your trip.</p>
          <p>Solar Fort√∫n has two different locations open to the public:</p><p>Our vineyard is located in Francisco Zarco in the northern edge of Valle de Guadalupe where you will find our beautiful property and tasting terrace surrounded by centennial old oak trees. We are open at this location on Saturdays and Sundays from 11am to 6pm and have a seasonal restaurant that specialized in food that pairs phenomenally with our wines.</p>

          <p>Our winemaking facilities are located in el sauzal, at the entrance to Ensenada right in front of the ocean.  Here we have VIP barrel tastings (reservation only) and starting summer 2021 we will have an oceanfront winebar. Plans for a new restaurant at this location are currently being developed.</p>
